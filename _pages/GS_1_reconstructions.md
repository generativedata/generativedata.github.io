## Generation Conditions

For the following examples, we grab 50 random samples from the test set, flatten them into single-voice rhythms,
and then generate 2-bar drums accordingly. The generations are divided per genre.

> Make sure you select the `MIDI File` and `Beta` dropdowns to listen to load and listen to the files.

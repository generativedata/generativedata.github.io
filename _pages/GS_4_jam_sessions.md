## Jam Session Recordings

All the following sessions are live recordings of a number of jam sessions with
the system. The sessions were done by the authors of the paper.

### 1  

---

Live accompaniment generated based on a live synth performance. Drums synthesized using Microtonic layered with Acoustic drums

### 2

Here we play a sequence of chords (MIDI) and also play the synthesizer live. The drum accompaniments are generated using a modular patch and near the end using acoustic drums as well.

### 4

In this one, we have programmed 4 sequences on the Electron Analog Four synth which are enabled/disabled during the performance. These sequences drive the accompaniment engine while we perform live on a separate synth as well. At times, we don't feed the groove of the live performance to the system so that the groove is stable and more conditioned on the programmed sequences

### 5 & 6 

---

These jams were done entirely in Ableton. However, we live looped many parallel midi sequences and also played live patterns that were fed to the accompaniment generator. All drums were synthesized using an acoustic drum kit

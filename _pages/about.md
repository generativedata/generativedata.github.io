In this website, we provide a number of additional resources to complement the paper submitted to `ISMIR 2024`.

[//]: # (Setup:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- An arpegiating bassline played back using an ableton stock plugin)

[//]: # (- An Arturia Polybrute synthesizer played live. )

[//]: # (- `GrooveTransformer`receiving MIDI grooves from both the arpegiated basseline and the live performance on the synthesizer)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Drum Synthesis:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- [Cardinal]&#40;https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal&#41; Virtual Eurorack Environment)

[//]: # (- Cardinal receives the generated drums, strips the gats and velocities to trigger the modules)

[//]: # (- Triggers used to activate voices while velocities are used either as VCA gains and/or synthesis parameters. )

[//]: # (- While 9 voices are generated, some voices were grouped together)

[//]: # (- Typical Kick and Snare &#40;with velocity controled VCAs&#41; were used for kick and snares)

[//]: # (- A single FM Operator was used for all hats &#40;closed and open&#41;. The decay of the envelop was controlled by the type of trigger)

[//]: # (- For Rides and Toms, two separate Mutable Instrument Plait modules were used.)

#### **Live Performance**
---

The following two excerpt are from the live performance using the system. 
As mentioned in the paper, the system was developed in collaboration with ANON, 
for a series of recuring live performances.

> **Note**  
> The organizers of the concert have recorded the entire performance, and will release the videos to the public soon. 
> we will link the full video here.

#### **Real-time Jams**
---

The following jams were conducted by the authors of the paper. 
These demos have not been editted, and are presented as recorded.
